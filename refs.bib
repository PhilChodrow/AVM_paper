abstract = {Evolutionary dynamics are affected by population structure, mutation rates and update rules. Spatial or network structure facilitates the clustering of strategies, which represents a mechanism for the evolution of cooperation. Mutation dilutes this effect. Here we analyze how mutation influences evolutionary clustering on graphs. We introduce new mathematical methods to evolutionary game theory, specifically the analysis of coalescing random walks via generating functions. These techniques allow us to derive exact identity-by-descent (IBD) probabilities, which characterize spatial assortment on lattices and Cayley trees. From these IBD probabilities we obtain exact conditions for the evolution of cooperation and other game strategies, showing the dual effects of graph topology and mutation rate. High mutation rates diminish the clustering of cooperators, hindering their evolutionary success. Our model can represent either genetic evolution with mutation, or social imitation processes with random strategy exploration. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Progress in theoretical physics is often made by the investigation of toy models, the model organisms of physics, which provide benchmarks for new methodologies. For complex systems, one such model is the adaptive voter model. Despite its simplicity, the model is hard to analyze. Only inaccurate results are obtained from well-established approximation schemes that work well on closely-related models. We use the adaptive voter model to illustrate a new approach that combines (a) the use of a heterogeneous moment expansion to approximate the network model by an infinite system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), (b) generating functions to map the ODE system to a two-dimensional partial differential equation (PDE), and (c) solution of this partial differential equation by the tools of PDE-theory. Beyond the adaptive voter models, the proposed approach establishes a connection between network science and the theory of PDEs and is widely applicable to the dynamics of networks with discrete node-states.},

How many time steps {\$}T{\$} does it take to completely infect a network of {\$}N{\$} nodes, starting from a single infected node?

abstract = {Evolutionary graph theory studies the evolutionary dynamics of populations structured on graphs. A central problem is determining the probability that a small number of mutants overtake a population. Currently, Monte Carlo simulations are used for estimating such fixation probabilities on general directed graphs, since no good analytical methods exist. In this paper, we introduce a novel deterministic framework for computing fixation probabilities for strongly connected, directed, weighted evolutionary graphs under neutral drift. We show how this framework can also be used to calculate the expected number of mutants at a given time step (even if we relax the assumption that the graph is strongly connected), how it can extend to other related models (e.g. voter model), how our framework can provide non-trivial bounds for fixation probability in the case of an advantageous mutant, and how it can be used to find a non-trivial lower bound on the mean time to fixation. We provide various experimental results determining fixation probabilities and expected number of mutants on different graphs. Among these, we show that our method consistently outperforms Monte Carlo simulations in speed by several orders of magnitude. Finally we show how our approach can provide insight into synaptic competition in neurology. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {We study evolutionary dynamics in a population whose structure is given by two graphs: the interaction graph determines who plays with whom in an evolutionary game; the replacement graph specifies the geometry of evolutionary competition and updating. First, we calculate the fixation probabilities of frequency dependent selection between two strategies or phenotypes. We consider three different update mechanisms: birth-death, death-birth and imitation. Then, as a particular example, we explore the evolution of cooperation. Suppose the interaction graph is a regular graph of degree h, the replacement graph is a regular graph of degree g and the overlap between the two graphs is a regular graph of degree l. We show that cooperation is favored by natural selection if b / c {\textgreater} hg / l. Here, b and c denote the benefit and cost of the altruistic act. This result holds for death-birth updating, weak-selection and large population size. Note that the optimum population structure for cooperators is given by maximum overlap between the interaction and the replacement graph (g = h = l), which means that the two graphs are identical. We also prove that a modified replicator equation can describe how the expected values of the frequencies of an arbitrary number of strategies change on replacement and interaction graphs: the two graphs induce a transformation of the payoff matrix. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We introduce a noisy voter model (accounting for social influence) with agents' recurrent mobility (as a proxy for social context), where the spatial and population diversity are taken as inputs to the model. We show that the dynamics can be described as a noisy diffusive process that contains the proper anysotropic coupling topology given by population and mobility heterogeneity. The model captures statistical features of the US presidential elections as the stationary vote-share fluctuations across counties, and the long-range spatial correlations that decay logarithmically with the distance. Furthermore, it recovers the behavior of these properties when a real-space renormalization is performed by coarse-graining the geographical scale from county level through congressional districts and up to states. Finally, we analyze the role of the mobility range and the randomness in decision making which are consistent with the empirical observations.},

abstract = {A wide class of binary-state dynamics on networks---including, for example, the voter model, the Bass diffusion model, and threshold models---can be described in terms of transition rates (spin-flip probabilities) that depend on the number of nearest neighbors in each of the two possible states. High-accuracy approximations for the emergent dynamics of such models on uncorrelated, infinite networks are given by recently-developed compartmental models or approximate master equations (AME). Pair approximations (PA) and mean-field theories can be systematically derived from the AME. We show that PA and AME solutions can coincide under certain circumstances, and numerical simulations confirm that PA is highly accurate in these cases. For monotone dynamics (where transitions out of one nodal state are impossible, e.g., SI disease-spread or Bass diffusion), PA and AME give identical results for the fraction of nodes in the infected (active) state for all time, provided the rate of infection depends linearly on the number of infected neighbors. In the more general non-monotone case, we derive a condition---that proves equivalent to a detailed balance condition on the dynamics---for PA and AME solutions to coincide in the limit {\$}t \backslashto \backslashinfty{\$}. This permits bifurcation analysis, yielding explicit expressions for the critical (ferromagnetic/paramagnetic transition) point of such dynamics, closely analogous to the critical temperature of the Ising spin model. Finally, the AME for threshold models of propagation is shown to reduce to just two differential equations, and to give excellent agreement with numerical simulations. As part of this work, Matlab code for implementing and solving the differential equation systems is made available for download.},

abstract = {In the social, behavioral, and economic sciences, it is an important problem to predict which individual opinions will eventually dominate in a large population, if there will be a consensus, and how long it takes a consensus to form. This idea has been studied heavily both in physics and in other disciplines, and the answer depends strongly on both the model for opinions and for the network structure on which the opinions evolve. One model that was created to study consensus formation quantitatively is the Deffuant model, in which the opinion distribution of a population evolves via sequential random pairwise encounters. To consider the heterogeneity of interactions in a population due to social influence, we study the Deffuant model on various network structures (deterministic synthetic networks, random synthetic networks, and social networks constructed from Facebook data) using several interaction mechanisms. We numerically simulate the Deffuant model and conduct regression analyses to investigate the dependence of the convergence time to equilibrium on parameters, including a confidence bound for opinion updates, the number of participating entities, and their willingness to compromise. We find that network structure and parameter values both have an effect on the convergence time, and for some network topologies, the convergence time undergoes a transition at a critical value of the confidence bound. We discuss the number of opinion groups that form at equilibrium in terms of a confidence-bound threshold for a transition from consensus to multiple-opinion equilibria.},

abstract = {In the coevolving voter model, each voter has one of two diametrically opposite opinions, and a voter encountering a neighbor with the opposite opinion may either adopt it or rewire the connection to another randomly chosen voter sharing the same opinion. As we smoothly change the relative frequency of rewiring compared to that of adoption, there occurs a phase transition between an active phase and a frozen phase. By performing extensive Monte Carlo calculations, we show that the phase transition is characterized by critical exponents $\beta$=0.54(1) and $\nu$[over ¯]=1.5(1), which differ from the existing mean-field-type prediction. We furthermore extend the model by introducing a contrarian type that tries to have neighbors with the opposite opinion, and show that the critical behavior still belongs to the same universality class irrespective of such contrarians' fraction.},

abstract = {The difficulty in formulating analytical treatments in co-evolving networks is studied in light of the Vazquez–Egu{\'{i}}luz–San Miguel voter model (VM) and a modified VM (MVM) that introduces a random mutation of the opinion as a noise in the VM. The density of active links, which are links that connect the nodes of opposite opinions, is shown to be highly sensitive to both the degree k of a node and the active links n among the neighbors of a node. We test the validity in the formalism of analytical approaches and show explicitly that the assumptions behind the commonly used homogeneous pair approximation scheme in formulating a mean-field theory are the source of the theory's failure due to the strong correlations between k, n and n2. An improved approach that incorporates spatial correlation to the nearest-neighbors explicitly and a random approximation for the next-nearest neighbors is formulated for the VM and the MVM, and it gives better agreement with the simulation results. We introduce an empirical approach that quantifies the correlations more accurately and gives results in good agreement with the simulation results. The work clarifies why simply mean-field theory fails and sheds light on how to analyze the correlations in the dynamic equations that are often generated in co-evolving processes.},

abstract = {Even though transitivity is a central structural feature of social networks, its influence on epidemic spread on coevolving networks has remained relatively unexplored. Here we introduce and study an adaptive SIS epidemic model wherein the infection and network coevolve with non-trivial probability to close triangles during edge rewiring, leading to substantial reinforcement of network transitivity. This new model provides a unique opportunity to study the role of transitivity in altering the SIS dynamics on a coevolving network. Using numerical simulations and Approximate Master Equations (AME), we identify and examine a rich set of dynamical features in the new model. In many cases, the AME including transitivity reinforcement provide accurate predictions of stationary-state disease prevalence and network degree distributions. Furthermore, for some parameter settings, the AME accurately trace the temporal evolution of the system. We show that higher transitivity reinforcement in the model leads to lower levels of infective individuals in the population; when closing a triangle is the only rewiring mechanism. These methods and results may be useful in developing ideas and modeling strategies for controlling SIS type epidemics.},

These models divide into two classes, those in which individuals form their beliefs based on the opinions of their neighbors in a social network of personal acquaintances, and those in which, conversely, network connections form between individuals of similar beliefs. While both of these processes can give rise to realistic levels of agreement between acquaintances, practical experience suggests that opinion formation in the real world is not a result of one process or the other, but a combination of the two. Here we present a simple model of this combination, with a single parameter controlling the balance of the two processes.

Edges are picked at random. If the two connected individuals hold different opinions then, with probability 1 - $\alpha$, one imitates the opinion of the other; otherwise (i.e., with probability $\alpha$), the link between them is broken and one of them makes a new connection to an individual chosen at random (i) from those with the same opinion or (ii) from the network as a whole. The evolution of the system stops when there are no longer any discordant edges connecting individuals with different opinions. Letting $\rho$ be the fraction of voters holding the minority opinion after the evolution stops, we are interested in how $\rho$ depends on $\alpha$ and the initial fraction u of voters with opinion 1. In case (i), there is a critical value $\alpha$(c) which does not depend on u, with $\rho$ ≈ u for $\alpha$ {\textgreater} $\alpha$(c) and $\rho$ ≈ 0 for $\alpha$ {\textless} $\alpha$(c). In case (ii), the transition point $\alpha$(c)(u) depends on the initial density u. For $\alpha$ {\textgreater} $\alpha$(c)(u), $\rho$ ≈ u, but for $\alpha$ {\textless} $\alpha$(c)(u), we have $\rho$($\alpha$,u) = $\rho$($\alpha$,1/2).

abstract = {This chapter provides a self-contained introduction to the use of Bayesian inference to extract large-scale modular structures from network data, based on the stochastic block model (SBM), as well as its degree-corrected and overlapping generalizations. We focus on nonparametric formulations that allow their inference in a manner that prevents overfitting, and enables model selection. We discuss aspects of the choice of priors, in particular how to avoid underfitting via increased Bayesian hierarchies, and we contrast the task of sampling network partitions from the posterior distribution with finding the single point estimate that maximizes it, while describing efficient algorithms to perform either one. We also show how inferring the SBM can be used to predict missing and spurious links, and shed light on the fundamental limitations of the detectability of modular structures in networks.},

abstract = {For many networks of scientific interest we know both the connections of the network and information about the network nodes, such as the age or gender of individuals in a social network, geographic location of nodes in the Internet, or cellular function of nodes in a gene regulatory network. Here we demonstrate how this "metadata" can be used to improve our analysis and understanding of network structure. We focus in particular on the problem of community detection in networks and develop a mathematically principled approach that combines a network and its metadata to detect communities more accurately than can be done with either alone. Crucially, the method does not assume that the metadata are correlated with the communities we are trying to find. Instead the method learns whether a correlation exists and correctly uses or ignores the metadata depending on whether they contain useful information. The learned correlations are also of interest in their own right, allowing us to make predictions about the community membership of nodes whose network connections are unknown. We demonstrate our method on synthetic networks with known structure and on real-world networks, large and small, drawn from social, biological, and technological domains.},

@article{Peel2016,
abstract = {Across many scientific domains, there is a common need to automatically extract a simplified view or coarse-graining of how a complex system's components interact. This general task is called community detection in networks and is analogous to searching for clusters in independent vector data. It is common to evaluate the performance of community detection algorithms by their ability to find so-called "ground truth" communities. This works well in synthetic networks with planted communities because such networks' links are formed explicitly based on those known communities. However, there are no planted communities in real world networks. Instead, it is standard practice to treat some observed discrete-valued node attributes, or metadata, as ground truth. Here, we show that metadata are not the same as ground truth, and that treating them as such induces severe theoretical and practical problems. We prove that no algorithm can uniquely solve community detection, and we prove a general No Free Lunch theorem for community detection, which implies that there can be no algorithm that is optimal for all possible community detection tasks. However, community detection remains a powerful tool and node metadata still have value so a careful exploration of their relationship with network structure can yield insights of genuine worth. We illustrate this point by introducing two statistical techniques that can quantify the relationship between metadata and community structure for a broad class of models. We demonstrate these techniques using both synthetic and real-world networks, and for multiple types of metadata and community structure.},

A simple stochastic model for this process is described and rules are given for the calculation, as a function of time, of the probabilities that individual territories and groups of territories are held by a single species. Asymptotic results are given for the pattern of territories held by a single species, and here a remarkable distinction is seen between the cases of one-dimensional and two-dimensional competition and the case of three-dimensional competition. The process of invasion is contrasted with two relatively benign processes, that in which an exchange of territories is arranged and that in which a spatial alternation of species may be beneficial to the community. The implications of the long-term behaviour of such processes are discussed. It is suggested further that, under certain ideal conditions, it may be possible to estimate the duration of a spatial struggle for life by observing at some time the configuration of territories held by each species.},

abstract = {Are we as a society getting more polarized, and if so, why? We try to answer this question through a model of opinion formation. Empirical studies have shown that homophily results in polarization. However, we show that DeGroot's well-known model of opinion formation based on repeated averaging can never be polarizing, even if individuals are arbitrarily homophilous. We generalize DeGroot's model to account for a phenomenon well-known in social psychology as biased assimilation: when presented with mixed or inconclusive evidence on a complex issue, individuals draw undue support for their initial position thereby arriving at a more extreme opinion. We show that in a simple model of homophilous networks, our biased opinion formation process results in either polarization, persistent disagreement or consensus depending on how biased individuals are. In other words, homophily alone, without biased assimilation, is not sufficient to polarize society. Quite interestingly, biased assimilation also provides insight into the following related question: do internet based recommender algorithms that show us personalized content contribute to polarization? We make a connection between biased assimilation and the polarizing effects of some random-walk based recommender algorithms that are similar in spirit to some commonly used recommender algorithms.},

@article{Macy2003,
abstract = {Why do populations often self-organize into antagonistic groups even in the absence of competition over scarce resources? Is there a tendency to demarcate groups of “us” and “them” that is inscribed in our cognitive architecture? We look for answers by exploring the dynamics of influence and attraction between computational agents. Our model is an extension of Hopfield's attractor network. Agents are attracted to others with similar states (the principle of homophily) and are also influenced by others, as conditioned by the strength and valence of the social tie. Negative valence implies xenophobia (instead of homophily) and differentiation (instead of imitation). Consistent with earlier work on structural balance, we find that networks can self- organize into two antagonistic factions, without the knowledge or intent of the agents. We model this tendency as a function of network size, the number of potentially contentious issues, and agents' openness and flexibility toward alternative positions. Although we find that polarization into two antagonistic groups is a unique global attractor, we investigate the conditions under which uniform and pluralistic alignments may also be equilibria. From a random start, agents can self-organize into pluralistic arrangements if the population size is large relative to the size of the state space. Copyright},

The process leading to fission is viewed as an unequal flow of sentiments and information across the ties in a social network. This flow is unequal because it is uniquely constrained by the contextual range and sensitivity of each relationship in the network. The subsequent differential sharing of sentiments leads to the formation of subgroups with more internal stability than the group as a whole, and results in fission. The Ford-Fulkerson labeling algorithm allows an accurate prediction of membership in the subgroups and of the locus of the fission to be made from measurements of the potential for information flow across each edge in the network. Methods for measurement of potential information flow are discussed, and it is shown that all appropriate techniques will generate the same predictions.},

There is a coevolution of state dynamics, where a node can copy a state from a random neighbor with probabilty 1 − p and link dynamics, where a node can re-wire its link to another node of the same state with probability p. That exhibits an absorbing transition to a frozen phase above a critical value of rewiring probability. Our analytical and numerical studies show that in the active phase mean values of magnetization of nodes n and links m tend to the same value that depends on initial conditions. In a similar way mean degrees of spins up and spins down become equal. The system obeys a special statistical conservation law since a linear combination of both types magnetizations averaged over many realizations starting from the same initial conditions is a constant of motion: $\Lambda$ ≡ (1 − p)µm(t) + pn(t) = const, where µ is the mean node degree. The final mean magnetization of nodes and links in the active phase is proportional to $\Lambda$ while the final density of active links is a square function of $\Lambda$. If the rewiring probability is above a critical value and the system separates into disconnected domains, then the values of nodes and links magnetizations are not the same and final mean degrees of spins up and spins down can be different.},

They combine topological evolution of the network with dynamics in the network nodes. Recently, the dynamics of adaptive networks has been investigated in a number of parallel studies from different fields, ranging from genomics to game theory. Here we review these recent developments and show that they can be viewed from a unique angle. We demonstrate that all these studies are characterized by common themes, most prominently: complex dynamics and robust topological self-organization based on simple local rules.}, number={20}, journal={Journal of The Royal Society Interface}, author={Gross, Thilo and Blasius, Bernd}, year={2008}, month={Mar}, pages={259–271} }
 
 @article{Gross2006, title={Epidemic Dynamics on an Adaptive Network}, volume={96}, DOI={10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.208701}, abstractNote={Many real-world networks are characterized by adaptive changes in their topology depending on the state of their nodes. Here we study epidemic dynamics on an adaptive network, where the susceptibles are able to avoid contact with the infected by rewiring their network connections. This gives rise to assortative degree correlation, oscillations, hysteresis, and first order transitions. We propose a low-dimensional model to describe the system and present a full local bifurcation analysis. Our results indicate that the interplay between dynamics and topology can have important consequences for the spreading of infectious diseases and related applications.}, number={20}, journal={Physical Review Letters}, author={Gross, Thilo and D’Lima, Carlos J.

For complex systems, one such model is the adaptive voter model. Despite its simplicity, the model is hard to analyze. Only inaccurate results are obtained from well-established approximation schemes that work well on closely-related models. We use the adaptive voter model to illustrate a new approach that combines (a) the use of a heterogeneous moment expansion to approximate the network model by an infinite system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), (b) generating functions to map the ODE system to a two-dimensional partial differential equation (PDE), and (c) solution of this partial differential equation by the tools of PDE-theory. Beyond the adaptive voter models, the proposed approach establishes a connection between network science and the theory of PDEs and is widely applicable to the dynamics of networks with discrete node-states.}, number={9}, journal={New Journal of Physics}, author={Silk, Holly and Demirel, Güven and Homer, Martin and Gross, Thilo}, year={2014}, pages={093051} }
 
 @article{Gross2012, title={Early fragmentation in the adaptive voter model on directed networks}, volume={85}, DOI={10.1103/PhysRevE.85.046107}, abstractNote={We consider voter dynamics on a directed adaptive network with fixed out-degree distribution. A transition between an active phase and a fragmented phase is observed. This transition is similar to the undirected case if the networks are sufficiently dense and have a narrow out-degree distribution. However, if a significant number of nodes with low out degree is present, then fragmentation can occur even far below the estimated critical point due to the formation of self-stabilizing structures that nucleate fragmentation. This process may be relevant for fragmentation in current political opinion formation processes.}, number={4}, journal={Physical Review E}, author={Zschaler, Gerd and Böhme, Gesa A. and Seißinger, Michael and Huepe, Cristián and Gross, Thilo}, year={2012}, month={Apr}, pages={046107} }
