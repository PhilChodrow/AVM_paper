\begin{abstract}
	``Co-evolving" or ``adaptive" voter models (AVMs) are \pjm{Add something else here too?} natural systems for modeling the emergence of mesoscopic community structure from local social decision-processes driven by argumentation and homophily. 
	Because of this, many methods for studying the long-run behavior of AVMs have been proposed over the last decade. 
	However, most such methods are either restricted in scope, computationally expensive, or predictively inaccurate. \pjm{Be precise what we mean} 
	In this work, we develop a novel, 2nd-order moment closure approximation method for studying the equilibrium community structure of AVMs, applying it to binary-state rewire-to-random and rewire-to-same model variants. \pjm{Mutation should be in the abstract somewhere?}
	This framework exploits an asymmetry in voting events that enables us to derive analytic approximations for the fast-timescale dynamics of active edges generated by a voting event on a selected focal node. 
	The resulting numerical approximations enable the computation of key properties of the model behavior, such as the location of the fragmentation transition and the equilibrium active edge density, across the entire range of relative opinion densities. 
	Numerically, they are nearly exact for the rewire-to-random model, and competitive with other current approaches for the rewire-to-same model. 
	We conclude with suggestions for both model refinement and extensions to more complex models.

\section{Introduction}

	A common feature of social networks is assortativity, the tendency of people who share similar attributes to interact more intensely or frequently than those who do not.
	Assortativity can be beneficial, allowing communities of individuals who share common beliefs or experiences to pursue shared goals. 
	On the other hand, assortativity can also restrict flows of information and resources between homogeneous groups. 
	Recent scrutiny, for example, has fallen on the role of online platforms in promoting political polarization by allowing users to micromanage their contacts and information sources \cite{Bakshy2015,Anagnostopoulos2014}. 
	Polarization in turn contributes to undesirable social and political outcomes, including the propagation of untruthful reporting\cite{Lazer2018}, uncompetitive elections \cite{Abramowitz2006}, legislative deadlock \cite{Layman2006}. 
	It is therefore of importance to develop quantitative theories of how opinion-based sorting drives large-scale network assortativity. 

	Assortativity in networks has often been studied within the framework of \emph{community structure}, a study that extends at least as far back as the reporting of the now-infamous Zachary Karate Club network \cite{Zachary1977} in which polarized factions of martial artists zfissioned into separate clubs.  
	Informally, a network displays community structure when it can be partitioned into groups in such a way nodes within each group are strongly connected within their group and only weakly connected beyond their group. 
	The model-based approach to the study of communities is largely statistical, dominated by the stochastic blockmodel and its variants.  
	The stochastic blockmodel is a planted-partition model that assigns a probability to each possible configuration of community labels. 
	Communities community-detection in this context is treated as a statistical inference problem, an approach which has the benefit of  mathematical grounding and useful theoretical connections to the popular practical method of modularity maximization \cite{Newman2016a}. 
	Sophisticated methods have recently emerged that incorporate additional graph metadata \cite{Peel2016,Newman2016b} or Bayesian model selection \cite{Peixoto2017a,Peixoto2017d}. 
	See \cite{Shai2017} for a useful review of recent developments and discussion of illustrative case studies. 
	\todo{Peter, this might be a good place to add references, including to some of your own favorite papers.}

	While community-structured networks appear to be ubiquitous, relatively few quantitative stories exist to describe how they come to display or maintain that structure. 
	A model due to \cite{Kumpula2007} mechanistically generates communities using two purely topological mechanisms: triadic closure and global attachment. 
	This model produces attractive, tunable community structures, but its purely topological structure makes it inappropriate for studying the interaction between topology and agent attributes. 
	Inspired by the classical Schelling model of urban segregation \cite{Schelling1979}, the authors of \cite{Henry2011} consider a network in which agents are assigned an immutable attribute vector that may model demographics or opinions. 
	Agents are allowed to rewire their connections to dissimilar partners, selecting new ones via global attachment, with the aversion to dissimilarity governed by a parameter. 
	As the authors prove, the model always generates segregated communities for any nonzero degree of dissimilarity aversion. 
	However, the node attributes are generated exogenously to the system dynamics.
	This model is therefore appropriate for studying assortativity based on immutable traits such as skin color, but less appropriate for opinions, over which the views of associates may have considerable influence.
	Because the node attributes are exogeneous to the system dynamics, this model is most appropriate for studying demographic segregation, rather than mutable opinions. 
	At the other extreme is the classical voter model \cite{Clifford1973,Holley1975}, in which node attributes change in response to local influence but the network topology remains constant.

\pjm{The previous paragraphs are really heavy on community structure. We want to streamline this to get the focus more on coevolving/adaptive systems.}
	Over the last decade, a class of coevolutionary models has emerged that enforces dynamical coupling between node attributes and edge topology, and which are therefore well suited to the study of opinion-based assortativity.
	This class, which we will refer to collectively as \emph{adaptive voter models} (AVMs), are endowed with two dynamical update steps. 
	In a \emph{voting} step, a node adopts the opinion of one of its neighbors according to a specified update rule. (We refer to this opinion-adoption as ``voting'' to distinguish from other opinion changes considered later in the paper.)
	In a \emph{rewiring} step, a node cuts its ties to a disagreeing neighbor and selects a new neighbor from the remainder of the social graph. 
	The relative frequency of rewiring and voting events is governed by a tuneable parameter. 
	These dynamics combine to generate polarized networks of opinion-based communities. 
	AVMs therefore offer a fully endogenous model of fragmentation, polarization, and segregation in information networks. 
	Beyond their social relevance, AVMs are interesting as theoretical objects, displaying phase transitions, metastability, and other rich behavior. 
	However, the nonlinearity driving this rich behavior renders AVMs extremely difficult to analyze even approximately. 
	Existing methods are typically significantly restricted at least one of scope, computational complexity, or accuracy, and often fail to provide significant physical intuition driving observed behaviors. 
	It is therefore of interest to seek new approximation schemes for this class of models. 
	Our aim in this paper is to use a seemingly under-noted observation to develop a class of approximation methods that both explain qualitative behaviors in these systems and provide unprecedented combinations of scope, computational efficiency, and accuracy. 

	The paper is structured as follows. \pjm{Add explicit section references to this paragraph.}
	We first review AVMs, defining their update dynamics, discussing the behavior of their most interesting observables, and surveying previous approaches for studying them. 
	We then describe the version of the AVM that is the focus of our present study, which modifies the model of \pjm{Which CITE here?} by introducing a small random opinion change. As a benefit of this additional randomness, the resulting dynamics provide for the existence of a well-defined equilibrium measure governing the long-term system behavior. This continually-evolving absorbing state contrasts with the different final ``freezing" states for each process outcome in the model without random opinion changes. \pjm{It occurs to me that we should be careful with the word ``mutation'' since there are models such as the continuous-valued opinions where it's a true mutation in the sense of giving rise to previously unobserved states; our model is a random switching}
	Using this measure, we observe an asymmetry in the structure of voting events, motivating it theoretically and then demonstrating it in simulation data. 
	We next leverage this asymmetry to construct a highly accurate approximation scheme for the subcritical behavior of the AVM. 
	Our approximation also generates useful intuition concerning a previously mysterious qualitative difference between the phase transitions of two variants of this adaptive system.
	We next use simple mean-field arguments to extend the approximation past the phase transition, thereby enabling us to estimate the quasistable manifold--the arch--along which the equilibrium distribution of the opinion counts and edge densities concentrates.
	We again demonstrate favorable scope, accuracy, and computational complexity in comparison to existing methods.
	We close with a discussion of promising extensions, both to our approximation methodology and to the model itself. 
	
\section{Adaptive Voter Models} \label{sec:AVMs}

	The minimal AVM is a stochastic process on a state-space of undirected, node-labeled multigraphs.\footnote{Adaptive network dynamics have also been studied in the context of epidemic spreading \cite{Marceau2010,Lee2017} and game theory \cite{Malik2016}; however, we will not consider these models here.} \pjm{We should find some other references to add to this footnote, and perhaps also move this footnote into a sentence in the Introduction} 
	A state of the AVM has the form $G = (\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{L}, \mathcal{E})$, where $\mathcal{N}$ is the set of nodes and $\mathcal{E}$ is the set of edges; $(u,v) \in \mathcal{E}$ means that an edge linking nodes $u$and $v$ is present in $\mathcal{G}$.
    Meanwhile, $\mathcal{L}$ is the (initially random) vector of node-labels, and may be viewed as a function $\mathcal{N} \rightarrow \mathcal{X}$ where $\mathcal{X}$ is the label alphabet.  
	While $\mathcal{N}$ is fixed, both $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{E}$ are allowed to vary with time. 
	Binary-state opinion dynamics, $\mathcal{X} = \{0,1\}$, are the most frequently considered, while interesting features also arise in multi-opinion dynamics \pjm{Cite the original HolmeNewman and the ShiDurrettMucha PRE}. In the present paper, we will restrict attention to the binary-state case.
	
	The (discrete-time) dynamics $(\mathcal{E}(t), \mathcal{L}(t)) \mapsto (\mathcal{E}(t+1), \mathcal{L}(t+1))$ are specified probabilistically by the following update rules, in terms of the constant rewiring rate parameter $\alpha\in [0,1]$. The step starts by sampling an edge $(u,v) \in \mathcal{E}(t)$ uniformly at random with random orientation, \emph{conditional} on the edge being \emph{active}: $\mathcal{L}_u(t) \neq \mathcal{L}_v(t)$. Then
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item With probability $\alpha$, \textbf{rewire}: delete the (undirected) edge $(u,v)$ and add edge $(u,w)$ selected according to one of the following two rules depending on the model variant being used. 
			In the \emph{rewire-to-random} model variant, $w$ is chosen uniformly from $\mathcal{N}\setminus \{u\}$. 
			In the \emph{rewire-to-same} variant, $w$ is chosen uniformly from the set $S_u = \{w' \in \mathcal{N}\setminus \{w\} | \mathcal{L}_{w'}(t) = \mathcal{L}_u(t)\}$. 
			\item Otherwise, with probability $1-\alpha$, \textbf{vote}:  $\mathcal{L}_u(t+1) \gets \mathcal{L}_v(t)$. 
		\end{enumerate}
    
	We note that the rewiring step as specified above allows the creation of multi-edges. \pjm{Just double-checking, What happens in later rewiring steps related to a node pair with multiple edges? I'm guessing that one of the multi-edges is selected and rewired. You don't rewire all of the corresponding edges between a pair at once, right? That would be an accumulation effect. We probably want to clarify exactly what happens in a sentence.} We note that multi-edges are explicitly forbidden as a condition of the rewiring in some other studies (e.g., \pjm{CITE THE TWO SHI PAPERS}), but in the limit of large, sparse graphs, the expected number of multi-edges encountered will be vanishingly small and this algorithmic detail becomes unimportant. 

\pjm{Fold the following citing sentences in earlier:} The multi-state rewire-to-same AVM was introduced and studied numerically by \cite{Holme2006}.
	The first analytical approximation techniques for the binary-state rewire-to-same AVM appeared in \cite{Kimura2008}. 
	The rewire-to-random variant was introduced and analyzed using multiple techniques by \cite{Durrett2012}.  

	The classical AVM displays rich properties, which we study using the following summary statistics. 
	Let $n = \abs{\mathcal{N}}$ be the number of nodes, $m = \abs{\mathcal{E}(t)}$ the number of edges, and $c = {2m}/{n}$ the mean degree.
	Since the dynamics conserve $n$ and $m$, $c$ is time-independent and may be regarded as an additional system parameter. 
	Let $N_i(t) = \abs{\{u \in \mathcal{N} \;|\;\mathcal{L}_u(t) = i \}}$ be the number of nodes holding opinion $i$ at time $t$. 
	We define $\q(t) = n^{-1}\left(N_0(t), N_1(t)\right)$ to be the vector of opinion densities.
	Let $M_{ij}(t) = \abs{\{(u,v) \in \mathcal{E} \;|\; \mathcal{L}_u(t) = i,\; \mathcal{L}_v(t) = j \}}$ be the number of \emph{oriented} edges between nodes of opinion $i$ and nodes of opinion $j$. 
	Note that $M_{ij}(t) = M_{ji}(t)$ and $\sum_{i,j \in \mathcal{X}} M_{ij}(t) = 2m$ at all times $t$.
	We call an edge $(u,v)$ ``active'' if it is discordant, that is, $\mathcal{L}_u(t) \neq \mathcal{L}_v(t)$. 
	Let $\X(t) = m^{-1}\left(M_{00}, M_{01}, M_{10}, M_{11}\right)$ be the vector of edge densities. 
	We define the scalar $\rho(t) = M_{01} + M_{10}$ to be the overall density of active edges. 
	While $\rho$ may in principle range between $0$ and $1$, the assortative dynamics ensure that $\rho \in [0,\frac{1}{2}]$ with high probability as $n$ grows large. 
	For notational compactness, we will repress the argument $t$ when no possibility of confusion arises.

	As formulated above, the process stops when there are no active edges remaining, that is, when $\rho = 0$. This implies a fully fragmented final state in which there exist one or more connected components within each of which the labels are internally identical. 
	As noted in both \cite{Holme2006} and \cite{Durrett2012}, there is an intriguing phase transition in the final value of $\q$, the details of which depend on the precise model variant. 
	In each variant, there is a critical value of $\alpha$, depending on $\q(0)$, such that, if $\alpha \geq \alpha^*(\q(0))$, $\q \approx \q(0)$. 
	Otherwise, for $\alpha < \alpha^*(\q(0))$, the final value of $\q$ is governed by a bimodal distribution whose modes are independent of $\q(0)$, determined instead by $\alpha$ and the rewiring mode. \pjm{Double-checking your intent here, it's only bimodal for two opinions, right? Can we simply drop the word ``bimodal'' here and everything is then okay?}
	In the rewire-to-same case, the modes lie at $\q = (1,0)$ and $\q = (0,1)$, while in the rewire-to-random case, both components of the modes are nonzero and depend on $\alpha$ and the mean degree $c$. 
	This phase transition marks the point at which the rewiring dynamics outstrip the voting process, and therefore also corresponds to a transition in the time to reach the final state \cite{Holme2006,Rogers2013}. 
	In \cite{Durrett2012}, the authors show that the phase transition also corresponds to the properties of a \emph{quasistable manifold} that is well approximated as a concave parabola in the $\q$-$\rho$ plane which the authors accordingly dub ``the arch.'' 
	The arch expresses $\rho^*$, the expected discordant edge density, as a function of $\alpha$ and $\q$. 
	\begin{figure}
	 	\centering
	 	\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{arch_illustration}
	 	\caption{Arches. 
	 	Points give traces of 10 sample simulations of AVMs with $n = 10^4$ and $c = 4$, run for $\times 10^7$ steps and sampled at intervals of $5\times 10^3$. 
	 	The horizontal axis gives the density $q_1$ of opinion-$1$ nodes, and the $y$-axis the active edge density $\rho$. 
	 	The rewiring rate $\alpha$ is $0.5$ for the rewire-to-random arch and $0.3$ for the rewire-to-same arch.
	 	Points above the arch are from earlier simulation steps.} \label{fig:arch_illustration}
	\end{figure} 
	A typical evolution of an AVM will converge rapidly toward a point on the arch, and then diffuse slowly along it toward one of the two points at the base, as shown in \Cref{fig:arch_illustration}.
	As remarked in \cite{Durrett2012} and illustrated by our simulation results plotted in  \Cref{fig:arch_illustration}, the rewire-to-random arch is supported on a proper subinterval of $[0,1]$ whenever $\alpha >0$, while the rewire-to-same arch is supported on the entirety of $[0,1]$. 
	In addition to being difficult to explain \pjm{what? the support or something more general here?}, the rewire-to-same behavior is also rather counterintuitive.
	In particular, when one of the opinion populations is small, the active edge density $\rho$ in the rewire-to-same model is actually \emph{higher} than in the rewire-to-random model with the same opinion counts and parameters.  
	This is in marked contrast to the expectation that the rapid sorting of edges via rewire-to-same would presumably lead to  smaller active edge densities. \pjm{Is it worth making a comment about how the pair approximation algebra works? That is, we have an ``explanation'' (poor perhaps) at that level, but I don't think we ``understand'' it.}
	To our knowledge, this qualitative difference in the phase transitions remains unexplained. 

	Theoretical studies of AVMs have tended to focus on one of several analytical tasks:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Estimation of the critical rewiring rate $\alpha^*$ for $\q = \left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)$ \cite{Bohme2011,Basu2015a}. We will refer to this as the symmetric opinion case. 
		\item Estimation of the quasistable density $\rho$ for $\q = \left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)$ \cite{Demirel2012,Silk2014,Ji2013}. 
		\item Estimation of the complete arch \cite{Durrett2012,Shi2013}. 
		\item Qualitative study of nonequilibrium system properties, including approximate conserved quantities \cite{Toruniewska2017} and topological structure near the phase transition $\alpha^*$ \cite{Horstmeyer2018}.
	\end{enumerate}
	We will focus on the first three tasks, which are ascending in scope. 
	That is, a complete estimate of the arch (\#3) suffices to estimate $\rho$ at any specific values of $\alpha$ and $\q$. 
	In turn, an estimate of $\rho$ as a function of $\alpha$ enables the estimation of $\alpha^*$ by solving $\rho = 0$ for $\alpha$. 
	
	There is of course a predictable, qualitative relationship between the scope of an approximation scheme, the accuracy of that scheme, and the cost of computing its estimates. 
	A common baseline for comparison in this literature is the all-purpose pair approximation (PA), which may be used to estimate the complete arch and may be computed fully analytically in closed form. 
	However, the PA is highly inaccurate with respect to both the location of the phase transition $\alpha^*$ and the supercritical active edge density $\rho$. \pjm{Add cite? Durrett2012 again?}
	More specialized methods are required to obtain quantitatively reasonable estimates. 
	The results of \cite{Basu2015a} \pjm{Add a phrase about the method?} are of unprecedented analytical rigor, but apply only to dense graphs and do not explicitly construct the value of $\alpha^*$ or even show the existence of a single, well-defined phase transition. 
	In \cite{Bohme2011}, a master equation-type approach is used to construct accurate estimates of the phase transition for the rewire-to-same model with symmetric opinion densities. 
	Computation requires a bisection search in $\alpha$ for which each function evaluation corresponds to finding the largest eigenvalue of a $c-1 \times c-1$ matrix. \pjm{Actually, shouldn't $c$ be $k_\mathrm{max}$ here?}
	The methodology is extended in \cite{Demirel2012} to the estimation of the quasistable active edge density for symmetric opinion densities, with reasonable quantitative results for the rewire-to-same case. 
	In \cite{Silk2014}, the authors convert the approximate master equation system into a single PDE, which they solve analytically. 
	Despite the elegance of the approach, the agreement with simulations is not strong. 
	The authors of \cite{Ji2013} also develop an interesting analytical framework for studying the quasistable active edge density with symmetric opinions, but their scheme contains constant terms that must be estimated from data. 

	Most work on AVMs does not attempt to compute the entire arch, despite the fact that the arch governs the long-run dynamics of the AVM. 
	To our knowledge, the only attempt to compute the form of the arch is given in \cite{Durrett2012}, which considers pair approximations as well as large systems of approximate master equations (AME, \cite{Gleeson2013}) to compute arches for both the rewire-to-random and rewire-to-same variants.
	The AME estimates for the arches significantly improve on the pair approximation, and display some of the qualitative features observed in simulations. 
	The results obtained by AME, however, possess several limitations. 
	They are intuitively opaque, making it difficult to understand why their predictions should deviate from simulations in the ways observed.  
	Furthermore, they are relatively computationally intensive (compared to, say, mean-field or pair-approximation approaches); in particular, the AME results in \cite{Durrett2012} requires the numerical solution of $\Theta(c^4)$ coupled differential equations, which quickly becomes impractical for even modest $c$. \pjm{$c$ should definitely be $k_\mathrm{max}$ here}

\section{AVMs with Mutation}
	\pjm{Again, maybe ``mutation'' becomes ``random opinion switching''? Or we can keep ``mutation'' throughout as long as we add one very clear sentence (I'll try; see if you like what I wrote further below).}
	Our present contribution exploits the properties of another variant of the AVM model. Specifically, we consider the minimal AVM as described above with the addition of a mutation step governed by the parameter $\lambda \in [0,1]$, which is used \emph{prior} to the edge sampling step described in \Cref{sec:AVMs} as follows. 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item With probability $\lambda$, \textbf{mutate}: uniformly sample a node $u$ from $\mathcal{N}$ and replace its opinion with a uniform sample from $\mathcal{X}$. 
		\item With probability $1-\lambda$, continue with the dynamics described in \Cref{sec:AVMs}. 
	\end{enumerate}
	When $\lambda = 0$, we recover the minimal AVM described in \Cref{sec:AVMs}. We note that this ``mutation'' step only involves the change of the opinion state of a randomly-selected node from its current opinion to one of the already allowed states in $\mathcal{X}$. That is, no new opinion labels are created in this mutation. \pjm{Add a ``cf." parenthetical here that cites one of the continuous-opinion models?} In the context of the binary-state opinion dynamics considered here, such mutation only involves a flip between the two allowed states.
    
	
	Mutation of the opinion held by a node in AVMs was first studied by \cite{Ji2013}, where the authors used it to ``stabilize'' their systems and enable focus on the symmetric opinion case $\q = \left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)$. 
    Consideration of mutation can be attractive from a modeling perspective; for instance, one might view the mutation process as reflecting exogeneous influence, such as media sources, noisy communication, or idiosyncratic growth that may coexist with the assortative AVM dynamics.  
	Our present use of the mutation rate $\lambda$ is rather different, leveraging the fact that this mutation renders the AVM ergodic, since any state can be reached from any other state via a sequence of mutations and rewirings, and the resulting AVM acquires a well-defined equilibrium measure over possible states describing its long-time behavior. \pjm{Do we need a symbol for the measure? That is, do we use it elsewhere? I removed it.}
	The corresponding arch is then a low-dimensional manifold along which the equilibrium measure concentrates when projected into the $\q$-$\rho$ plane. 
	The existence of the equilibrium measure will be extremely useful as we aim to derive approximations that are both accurate and intuitive. 
	
	\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{network_sample}
		\caption{Sample from the equilibrium distribution of a rewire-to-random AVM with $n = 400$ agents, mean degree $c = 10$, rewiring rate $\alpha = 0.9$, and mutation rate $\lambda = 0.01$. The active edge density is $\rho = 0.12$.} \label{fig:sample}
	\end{figure}
	
	An important corollary is that the network no longer freezes in fully-fragmented states with $\rho = 0$. 
	For $\alpha < \alpha^*$, a typical sample from the equilibrium distribution of $\mathcal{G}$ will display denser connections within opinion groups relative to sparser connections between groups, but typically not complete fragmentation along opinions. 
	\Cref{fig:sample} shows a single realization drawn from the equilibrium distribution (that is, at long times) for a small AVM. We note that this realization replicates the visual properties of other networks that have a large-scale organization into two communities. 
	The nontrivial long-term states of the mutating AVM make it a more realistic model---compared to the model without mutation---for social processes in which disagreement persists. The polarization between the two opinions depends on the mutation rate, but does not give an absolute permanent split into two components for non-zero mutation rates.
	\todo{Convergence proof? Show that $\lim_{\lambda \rightarrow 0} \x(\lambda) = \x(0)$? This would be extremely pleasant, but the only ways I see right now involve the implicit function theorem, and its conditions are difficult to verify in this case. Might be able to view the entire process as determined by the large-but-finite vector of moments?

			% $v(G)$ is $C^1$ in $x_2$ and regular (rank 2) at all values. 
			% implicit function theorem gives result. 
		}

			
	% \subsection{The Local Perspective} \label{subsec:local}
		
	An analytical benefit from the existence of an equilibrium distribution is that we may take a perturbative approach to studying model behavior. 
	% Most existing studies consider the phase transition of non-mutating AVM only in the context of a fixed class of initial states. 
	% Typically, $\mathcal{G}(0)$ is given as a Erd\"{o}s-Renyi random graph on $n$ nodes with prescribed mean degree $c$. \todo{Bohme is an exception.}
	% The opinion labels are initialized as i.i.d. Bernoullis on $\mathcal{N}$. 
	% This is a natural initial condition, but the absence of an equilibrium measure leaves open important questions. 
	% Principal among these is whether the observed behavior of the system--including the phase transition and the quasistable arch -- are intrinsic to the dynamics or artifacts of the selected initial state. 
	% The phenomenon of metastability suggests the former answer, but not conclusively. 
	% Because the equilibrium measure is independent of the initial state, we can study it to determine which behaviors of the model are intrinsic to the dynamics. 
	It is especially useful to consider the subcritical class of states in which $\mathcal{G}$ is fully fragmented, i.e. $\rho = 0$.
	As noted above, this class of states is trivially stable in non-mutating AVMs. 
	When $\lambda < 0$, however, the stability of this class of states depends on other system parameters. 
	Consider the genesis via mutation of a single dissenting node $u$. 
	Because $\mathcal{G}$ is otherwise uniform on its connected components, the fast-timescale dynamics concentrate in the neighborhood of $u$. 
	We distinguish two cases: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Subcriticality:} With high probability, the mutation on $u$ is eventually either snuffed out by voting or quarantined by rewiring. 
		\item \textbf{Criticality:} With nonzero probability, the mutation $u$ triggers a cascade of active edge-generation, which eventually generates a nonzero fraction of active edges in the large $n$ limit. 
	\end{enumerate}
	The ergodicity of the dynamics thus allows us to study criticality of the AVM similarly to criticality of elementary branching processes, abstracting away the global network structure in favor of the local properties of a single node. \pjm{I'm having a hard time with the word ``subcriticality'' in this paragraph, perhaps because it appeared before it was defined. Is it needed in the first sentence?. Are you implying there is a finite but non-zero $\lambda^*$? Or the whole point is you're going to end up showing below that $\lambda^*=0$? Also, what does it mean to have $\lambda<0$? That is, is the only feasible subcritical case when $\lambda=0$?}
	
		
	\subsection{Symmetry Breaking in Voting Behavior}
		To develop useful approximations, we leverage observations about the asymmetry between the local majority and local minority opinions. To our knowledge, the use of these observations for such modeling purposes has not previously appeared in the literature.
		Consider again the fragmented state $\rho = 0$, in which opinion labels are constant within each component (\Cref{fig:majorities}, left).  
		This is the extreme case in which we can distinguish a \emph{local majority}: in the neighborhood of any node, all other nodes share the same opinion. 
		Suppose that node $u$ mutates its opinion from $0$ to $1$. \pjm{Please add a $u$ label to the two panels of this figure.}
		On $C$, the component of which $u$ is a member, opinions are no longer constant.	
		Immediately after the mutation, and even after an $o\left(\abs{C}\right)$ number of follow-up voting events within the component (\Cref{fig:majorities}, right), opinion $1$ is still distinguishable as a local minority. That is, local neighborhoods within $C$ are still statistically dominated by opinion $0$ nodes.

In the subcritical parameter regime,  the mutation will eventually be neutralized: it will either be eliminated by $0\mapsto 1$ voting events \pjm{It should be the other way, right?}, or quarantined by rewirings. 
		Either result returns the system to the fully-fragmented regime until the next mutation event, after which the process will repeat. 
		The equilibrium behavior in the subcritical regime thus consists of a sequence of  ``outbreaks'' of local dissent spawned by mutations and contained by rapid rewiring and voting. 
		Because of this, in the subcritical regime there is a persistent distinction between local minority and local majority nodes. 
		Indeed, the argument extends to $0 < \rho o(1)$ \pjm{Is there a symbol missing here? $\sim$ perhaps?}, since when active edges are rare the local neighborhoods will exhibit similar asymmetry between the role \pjm{?} of the local minority and local majority nodes. 
        
		The importance of the local majority/minority distinction is that voting events by the two types of nodes have qualitatively different impacts on the edge density vector $\x$. 
		It is useful to name these two types of events. 
		In \emph{forward} votes, a member of the local majority adopts the opinion of the local minority, spreading the initial mutation. 
		In \emph{backward} votes, a member of the local minority adopts the opinion of the local minority, causing the initial mutation to retreat.  
		We emphasize that these two classes of events are distinct from the label-based classes $0\mapsto 1$ and $1 \mapsto 0$ events in that the label-based classes occur with equal frequency and at equilibrium have symmetric (equal and opposite) expected impacts on $\X$.
		In contrast, forward votes are both more numerous \pjm{at/above criticality?} and tend to increase $\rho$ by more than backward votes decrease it.  
		To see why, consider the sample scenario shown in \cref{fig:breaking_illustration}. 
		Opinion $1$ (orange) is a local minority in a component statistically dominated by opinion $0$ nodes (blue). 
		We join the action (\cref{subfig:first}) just after a forward voting event has resulted in node $u$ changing its opinion $0 \mapsto 1$. 
		We restrict attention to the three active edges attached to $u$, and start a local clock $\tau_u \in \mathbb{Z}_+$ that counts the number of events that remove a discordant edge from $u$ \pjm{This local clock confuses me and I'm not sure it really buys us that much here in this paragraph? Does anything bad happen if we simply remove it from the discussion?}. 
		At time $\tau_u = 0$, voting events along $u$'s active edges are symmetrical: the probability of forward and backward votes are equal. 
		A forward vote adds $2$ net active edges, while a backward vote removes $2$ net active edges. 
		This symmetry is broken by subsequent rewiring and voting events.
		\Cref{subfig:second} shows one possible realization at local time $\tau_u = 2$, in which two active edges have been rewired away from $u$. 
		While a forward vote still adds $2$ net active edges, a backward vote now has no net impact on the active edge density. 
		Intermediate voting events have even greater impact on the behavior of backward voting. 
		In \cref{subfig:third}, two forward voting events have taken place on active edges attached to $u$. 
		A backward vote by $u$ at this moment would remove $2$ net active edges. 
		These phenomena may be observed in simulation data, shown in \Cref{sec:simulation_symmetry} \pjm{Are you still planning to add this figure?}.

\section{Analytical Methods}
	We now develop an analytical framework that leverages the asymmetry between forward and backward votes to produce accurate approximations for $\rho^*(\q; c, \alpha)$, the equilibrium density of discordant edges given the opinion density $\q$ and parameters $c$ and $\alpha$. 

	Let $\x(t) = \E[\X(t)]$. 
	Conditioning on event types, the dynamics in $\x$ may be written
	\begin{align}
		m(\x(t+1) - \x(t)) = \lambda \mathbf{w}(\mathcal{G}(t)) + (1-\lambda)\alpha \mathbf{r}(\mathcal{G}(t)) + (1-\lambda)(1-\alpha) \mathbf{v}(\mathcal{G}(t))\;, \label{eq:dynamics}
	\end{align}
	where $\mathbf{w}$, $\mathbf{r}$, and $\mathbf{v}$ are functions of the graph state $\mathcal{G}(t)$ giving the increments in $\x$ due to mutation, rewiring, and voting, respectively. 
	Importantly, however, $\mathbf{w}$ and $\mathbf{r}$ depend only on $\q$ and $\x$, the zeroth and first moments of $\mathcal{G}$ \pjm{It's actually the first and second moments of the opinion distribution on $\mathcal{G}$, right?}. 
	To write out $\mathbf{w}$, it is useful to introduce the notation $\mathbf{c}$ with components $c_{ij} = c\frac{x_{ij}}{q_i}$ denoting the average number of neighbors of type $j$ of a node of type $i$. 
	Note that, while $x_{ij} = x_{ji}$, $c_{ij} \neq c_{ji}$ for $\q \neq \left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)$. 
	We can then write \pjm{Is this an improvement? Why not write it in terms of $\x$, as already indicated here?}
	\begin{align*}
		w_{ij}(\mathcal{G}) = w_{ij}(\x) = 
		\begin{cases}
			\q_{0}(c_{10} - c_{00}) &  i = j = 0 \\ 
			\q_1 (c_{01}-c_{11}) & i = j = 1 \\ 
			\q_0 (c_{00}  - c_{10}) +  \q_1(c_{11}-c_{01}) & i \neq j\;.
		\end{cases}
	\end{align*}
	To compute $\mathbf{r}$, we write \pjm{Easier to understand if you write it in the same form as w was just written?}
	\begin{align*}
		\mathbf{r}(\mathcal{G}) = \mathbf{r}(\q) = 
		\begin{cases}
			\left(\q_0, -\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}, \q_1\right) & \text{rewire-to-random}\\
			\left(1, -1, -1, 1\right) & \text{rewire-to-same}.
		\end{cases}
	\end{align*}
	The difficulty arises in that the voting function $\mathbf{v}$ cannot be similarly parsed exactly in any fixed, finite set of system moments \cite{Demirel2012}. 
	We may therefore view the short-timescale dynamics of $\x$ as the superposition of a Markovian process (in the space of $\q$ and $\x$) governed by mutation and rewiring with a non-Markovian process governed by voting. 
	
	\subsection{Phase Transition}
		Our analytical strategy is to replace the non-Markovian term with a Markovian approximation near the phase transition, which we do using the observations about the symmetry-breaking behavior discussed above. 
		We will suppose that 
		\begin{align}
			\mathbf{v}(\mathcal{G}) \approx \hat{\mathbf{v}}(\q, \x)\;, \label{eq:markov}
		\end{align}
		when $\rho \ll \frac{1}{2}$, which is a first-order Markovian assumption on $\x$ as a function of $\q$. 
		In this sense, our approach is similar to the common pair approximation (PA). 
		However, whereas the PA is a general approach that relies on a closure approximation, we here use the broken symmetry between forward and backward votes to directly develop more accurate approximations. 

		We fix node $u$, and suppose, as in \Cref{fig:breaking_illustration}, that at time $\tau = 0$, $u$ changed its opinion from $j \in \{0,1\}$ to $i \in \{1,0\}$ due to either a mutation or a voting step. 
		As a result of this event, $u$ now possesses certain (random) numbers $J_0$ of inactive and $K_0$ of active edges, whose distributions depend on $\q$, $\x$, and possibly higher-order moments as well.
		To approximate $\hat{v}$, we track each of the $K_0$ discordant edges until each of them has been made concordant, logging voting events along the way. 
		By doing so, we are able to distinguish between forward and backward votes, approximating both the frequency and impact of each on $\x$. 
		Averaging over those events thus provides an approximation for $\mathbf{v}$.
		The quality of the approximation depends on the extent to which the relative frequencies and effects of the tracked voting events reflect those which occur in the true system. 

	Assumptions of timescale separation and mean field majorities together make our calculation tractable.
	We assume that the remainder of $\mathcal{G}$ is changing slowly relative to the ego network of node $u$, so that only dynamics that sample the initial $K_0$ edges need to be accounted for. 
			This assumption will be strongest when $\rho \ll 1$ and $\lambda \ll 1$. 
	We also assume that nodes in the local majority have degree distributions governed by the global network average $\x$. 
		The mean-field approximation is used to approximate the distributions of $J_0$ and $K_0$. 
		Under our hypotheses, node $u$ was in the local majority in the immediately previous time-step before we joined the action (when node $u$ became a local minority node).
		This allows us to approximate the distributions of $J_0$ and $K_0$ in terms of $\q$ and $\x$. 
		In particular, we have that $\E[K_0] = c_{00}$. Meanwhile, $\E[J_0] = 1 + c_{01}$ if $u$ emerged as a forward vote or $\E[J_0] = 0$ if $u$ emerged as a mutation. 
		In the approximations below, we model each of $K_0$ and $J_0$ as truncated Poisson random variables with the appropriate averages. 

		We now define notation to track the various types of voting events. 
		Let $R$ be a random variable giving the number of voting events by neighbors of $u$. 
		By the timescale separation assumption, we may assume that each such vote happens along one of the $K_0$ initial active edges. 
		Since $u$ is assumed to be in the local minority, votes by neighbors are forward votes. 
		Let $W$ give the number of voting events by nodes not attached to $u$ due to one of the $K_0$ active edges \pjm{Looking for clarification: can we simply use the phrase you have in the ``rewire-to-random'' sentence to say clearly what this?}. 
		In the case of the rewire-to-same model, no such events occur. 
		In the rewire-to-random model, these events occur when an edge attached to $u$ is rewired in such a way that it is no longer attached to $u$, but to another node of the same opinion. 
		Let $\1_u$ be the indicator variable that $u$ changes its vote (i.e. votes backwards) prior to all $K_0$ active edges being resolved. 

		These variables will count the voting events, but we also require vectors to track the impact of a given event on $\x$. 
		Under the mean-field assumption, forward votes are governed by the global mean degrees $\C$. 
		The expected impact on $\x$ of votes counted by $R$ when $\mathcal{L}_u = 1$ on a component dominated by $0$s is given by \pjm{I'm admittedly a little confused by notation: can we be more explicit about the relationship between $R$ and the $\mathbf{h}$ items?}
		\begin{align}
			\mathbf{h}_1(\C) = \frac{1}{2}\left(-2c_{00} , c_{00} - c_{01} - 1, c_{00} - c_{01} - 1, 2(1+c_{01})\right)^T\;.
		\end{align}
		Interchanging the opinion indices gives the analogous expression for $\mathbf{h}_0$, the impact of forward votes when $u$ has opinion $0$ on a component dominated by $1$s. 
		Votes counted by $W$ are again mean-field approximated. Since their impact does not depend on $i$ \pjm{add a why phrase here}, yielding \pjm{I think the notation is a little confusing because we have $\mathbf{w}$ above for mutation events. Should we change the letter here (and, if so, in the previous paragraph---indeed, should we restructure this paragraph and the one above to more clearly separate the two counts (currently $R$ and $W$)?}
		\begin{align}
			\mathbf{w}(\C) = \frac{\mathbf{h}_0(\C) + \mathbf{h}_1(\C)}{2}\;.
		\end{align}

		It remains to consider the impact of a backward vote by $u$, for which the analysis is more subtle. 
		This term has components
		\begin{align}
			\mathbf{b}_1(\q, \C) = \left(2\E[K|1], \E[J-K|1], \E[J-K|1], -2\E[J|1]\right)\;,
		\end{align}
		where $J$ (respectively, $K$) are the number of inactive (active) edges attached to $u$ at the time of voting. 
		The expectations are conditioned on $\mathcal{L}_u = 1$.  
		With these terms, the expected increment in the edge counts due to voting is given by the 4-vector
		\begin{align}
			\hat{\mathbf{v}}(\q, \x) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \in \{0,1\}} \frac{\E[R|i]\mathbf{h}_i(\C) + \E[W|i]\mathbf{w}(\C) + \E[\1_u\mathbf{b}_i(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{c})|i]}{\E[R + S + \1_u|i]}\;. \label{eq:v_hat}
		\end{align}
		To complete the approximation scheme it remains only to compute the various expectations. Under the timescale-separation and mean-field approximations, this is possible analytically, as derived in \Cref{sec:calcs}: \pjm{In light of the short length of the supplement, I'm thinking we might be able to get away with it as an Appendix here instead? That's not a decision we need to make until we're all but ready to submit.}

			\begin{aligned}
				\E[R|i] &= 1 - \phi_{K_0}(\beta_i) \\

		With the expression \Cref{eq:v_hat} in place, we may then approximate the long-term dynamics of $\x$ under \Cref{eq:dynamics}, subject to the constraint that the components of $\x$ sum to unity. 
		We write $\hat{\x}(\q; \alpha)$ for the limit point of the dynamics. \todo{Uniqueness of $\hat{\x}$?}
		The approximation is subcritical when $\hat{\rho}(\q; \alpha) \triangleq 2\hat{\x}_{01}(\q; \alpha) = 0$, and supercritical otherwise. 
		Solving 
		\begin{align}
			\alpha^*(\q) = \max \{\alpha : \hat{\rho}(\q; \alpha) = 0\} \label{eq:transition_approx}
		\end{align}
		gives our approximation for the phase transition. 

		\Cref{fig:transition_joy} shows the approximate phase transitions computed using \Cref{eq:transition_approx} for varying $c$, in green, when $\q = \left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)$. % \footnote{Empirically, the rewire-to-random curve phase transition can also be computed by solving $\phi_{K_0}(\beta_i^{K_0}) \approx \frac{1}{2}$ for $\alpha$, which has a branching-process intuition behind it and leads to a much cleaner calculation. Intriguingly, the right constant for the rewire-to-same case appears to be $\phi_{K_0}(\beta_i^{K_0}) \approx \frac{1}{3}$} 
		Compared to the standard pair approximation (orange), the present approximation approach is substantially more accurate.
		Indeed, the calculation of the transition for the rewire-to-random model is the most accurate we know of, while the calculation for the rewire-to-same model is competitive with existing approaches.
		The approximation of the phase transition is more accurate than the Approximate Master Equations (AMEs) of \cite{Durrett2012} and the partial differential equation approach of \cite{Silk2014}. 
		The fan-motif method used by \cite{Bohme2011} to estimate the rewire-to-same phase transition is somewhat more accurate in that case, but also higher-dimensional, requiring a bisection search in $\alpha$ in which each stage computes the leading eigenvalue of a $c\times c$ matrix. \pjm{Just checking because of earlier questions: is it actually $c$ here or $k_\mathrm{max}$?} \todo[inline=true]{Consider adding this approximation into the figure to show its difficulties in the rewire-to-random case.}

		As discussed in \cite{Durrett2012} and shown in \Cref{fig:arch_illustration}, the phase transitions in the two models differ in their sensitivity to $\q$. 
		This behavior is reflected algebraically in \Cref{eq:component_approx}.
		As shown in \Cref{sec:SI_phase}, the expressions appearing in \Cref{eq:component_approx} depend on $\q$ in the rewire-to-random model regardless of $\x$. 
		However,  in the rewire-to-same model, dependence on $\q$ emerges only when $\rho > 0$, implying that the phase transition itself is independent of $\q$. 
		Furthermore, the local approximation scheme also gives us a physical interpretation of this mysterious behavior. 
		Consider the emergence of a mutant node $u$ with opinion $1$ on a component of majority opinion $0$. 
		In the rewire-to-random case, the fast local rewiring dynamics depend explicitly on $\q$, the \emph{global} opinion densities. 
		When $\q_1$ is large, an edge attached to $u$ and rewired is more likely to become inactive, resulting in fewer active edges in the neighborhood of $u$. 
		In the rewire-to-same case, however, the fast rewiring does not explicitly depend on $\q$. 
		An active edge attached to $u$ and rewired becomes inactive with probability $1$, regardless of the value of $\q$. 
		The local dynamics are not fully independent of $\q$, but the dependence is mediated by the slow voting dynamics. 
		\todo{This is correct but needs to be made much tighter -- look for a precise punchline.} \pjm{This intuition is really good here. I'm curious, there also seems to be a way in which the model for rewire-to-same has a degenerate behavior at small $\rho$ in that it also implies that one of the opinions is of small population, so then three of the edge types are small. I'm just babbling...}
	
	\subsection{Supercritical Equilibria}
		
		We now turn to the approximation of $\rho^*(\q;\alpha)$, the equilibrium density of discordant edges, for $\alpha < \alpha^*$. 
		In this regime, the separation of timescales assumption becomes progressively more inaccurate, and our explicit distinction between forward and backward votes breaks down. 
		In particular, the impact of a single node voting backwards progressively diminishes due to re-randomization of the node's local neighborhood between votes. 
		We address this via simple interpolation to an approximation of the case $\alpha = 0$, which corresponds to a variation of a ``pure'' voter model without rewiring. 
		A simple mean-field argument (given in \Cref{sec:SI_alpha_0}) provides an approximation for the $\alpha = 0$ arch:
		\begin{align}
			\rho^*(\q; 0) \approx 2q_1q_2\frac{c-1}{c}\;. \label{eq:alpha_0}
		\end{align}
		We note in passing that, despite the crudeness of this mean-field approximmation, this estimate for the $\alpha = 0$ arch is substantially more accurate than both the pair approximation in \cite{Durrett2012} and the even more sophisticated active-motif approach of \cite{Demirel2012}. 

		We introduce an interpolation function 
		\begin{align}
			s(\x) = \frac{\hat{\rho}^*(\q;0) - \rho}{\hat{\rho}^*(\q;0)}\;, \label{eq:interpolation}
		\end{align}
        \pjm{Are the hat accents here deliberately different from (4.9), which has no hat?}
		to quantify the distance of the system state from the estimated $\alpha = 0$ arch, and then use this interpolation function to introduce decay in the backward voting term of  \Cref{eq:component_approx}. [In numerical experiments, we found monotonic transformations of \Cref{eq:interpolation} to lead to similar results.] \todo{Probabilistically-principled form of interpolation function?}
		We then replace $\E[J - K|i]$ with $\E[J - K|i]s(\x)$ to reflect the diminishing influence of backward votes, obtaining 
		\begin{equation}
			\hat{v}(\q, \x) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \in \{0,1\}} \frac{\E[R|i]h_i(\C) + \E[W|i]w(\C) + \E[\1_u(J-K)|i]s(\x)}{\E[R + S + \1_u|i]}\;.  \label{eq:component_approx_super}
		\end{equation}
		\Cref{eq:component_approx_super} may then be substituted back into \Cref{eq:dynamics}; the corresponding solution for $\x$ then yields an approximation of $\mathbf{\rho}$. 
		\begin{figure}

		\end{figure}
		
		To evaluate the supercritical approximation, we first consider its performance on the standard estimation task with symmetric opinion densities. 
		\Cref{fig:arch_tops} shows the estimate for $\rho$ when $\q = \left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)$ for varying $\alpha$. 
		The rewire-to-random approximations are highly accurate, largely due to the accurate estimate of the phase transition. 
		The approximation deviates from simulations by no more than $5\%$. 
		This overall level of accuracy is comparable with that of the  Approximate Master Equation (AME) approach employed in \cite{Durrett2012}. \pjm{Is it really? Isn't it actually better than the AME result in the Durrett et al. paper? Or are you just being conservative? (Not that there's anything wrong with that!)}
		Interestingly, the two methods are most accurate in dramatically different regimes---whereas the AMEs are nearly exact for small $\alpha$ and decay in quality near $\alpha^*$, our present method is much more accurate near $\alpha^*$ but degrades slightly as $\alpha$ becomes small. 
		In the rewire-to-same case, the approximation is predictably weaker due to the larger error in the estimation of the phase transition. 
		There is larger deviation, on the order of $10\%$, in many of the simulation traces depending on $c$. 
		The overall approximation quality is again comparable to that of AMEs, but is outperformed by certain specialized methods such as the active-motif approach of \cite{Demirel2012}. 
		
		In addition to demonstrating favorable accuracy, the present approximation approach is much lower-dimensional than its competitors. 
		AMEs require the solution of $\Theta(c^4)$ \pjm{I think this is supposed to be $\sim k_\mathrm{max}^2$? I think better to express it in terms of this instead of $c=\langle k\rangle$ because the former isn't necessarily always proportional to the latter (especially for small $c$?)} coupled differential equations; in the $c = \langle k\rangle = 4$ case, the authors of \cite{Durrett2012} used $225$ such equations. 
		This makes the computation of equilibrium approximations computationally prohibitive for large $c$. 
		Active-motif methods also have similar scaling properties. \todo{What actually IS the difference between active-motif methods and AMEs?}
		In contrast, the present method displays constant scaling: there are four nonlinear equations to solve, regardless of the value of $c$. 
		The low-dimensional nature of the approximation also supports useful physical intuition -- each term is meaningful and corresponds to a distinctive event-type when viewed from the local perspective. 
		
		Turning now to the case $\q \neq \left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)$, \Cref{fig:arches} compares the curves obtained by numerically solving \Cref{eq:dynamics} as $\q$ varies. 
		Due to the accurate estimation of the location of the phase transition in $\alpha$, the arches for the rewire-to-random model agree well with the data both on the equilibrium active edge density and on the support of the arch -- the values of $\q$ for which $\rho^*(\q;\alpha) > 0$. 
		Compared to AMEs, the computed arches for the $c = 4$ rewire-to-random case are comparable in overall accuracy, better estimate the correct support, and also better capture the qualitative parabolic shape.  
		The accuracy of the approximation increases with $c$, but comparison to AMEs and active-motif approaches are no longer possible due to the computational costs of the latter two methods. 
		As with the $\q = \left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)$ case, the rewire-to-same results less accurate. 
		The computed arches do correctly span the entire interval $[0,1]$ for the rewire-to-same case (cf.\ the behavior of the rewire-to-random case). 
		The overall numerical accuracy in the $c = 4$ case is comparable to AMEs, but the qualitative parabolic shape has been lost. 
		The reason for this difference is not clear to the authors, and further investigation into this phenomenon is called for.

\section{Discussion}

	Adaptive voter models offer a simple rule set generating complex behaviors for how individual decisions about beliefs and social attachments can generate global, opinion-based polarization. 
	While the underlying rules are simple to state, the coevolving nature of the dynamics render these systems very challenging to analyze. 
	We have considered an ergodic adaptive voter model variant which enables a local perspective on fragmentation transitions and other model properties. 
	The local perspective allows us to use the asymmetry of voting events to develop Markovian approximations based on the fast time-scale dynamics around single nodes. 
	The resulting approach is conceptually intuitive, computationally tractable, and empirically accurate. 
	
	One of the most puzzling issues raised by our results is the difference between the accuracies of our approach for the rewire-to-random and rewire-to-same adaptive voter models. 
	While we succeed in characterizing the rewire-to-random arch nearly exactly, the same methods produce poorer results for the rewire-to-same model. 
	We conjecture that the rapid local sorting produced in rewire-to-same dynamics badly violates our mean-field assumption on forward votes, as suggested by the bottom-left panel of \Cref{fig:symmetry_breaking}. 
	It would be interesting to extend our methodology to see whether refinements are possible that better characterize the rewire-to-same behavior, and potentially shed light on the essential features governing the dramatic difference in the nature of the phase transitions in these two models. 
		
	It is also of substantial interest to consider extensions and generalizations. 
	The most natural extension is to the case of multiple opinion states and structured opinion spaces. 
	Previous work on multi-opinion models has been restricted to either characterization of the various phase transitions (\cite{Bohme2012}) or empirical discussion of supercritical equilibrium behavior (\cite{Shi2013}). 
	One explanation for this limitation in scope is computational, in that the number of operations required to compute approximations under active motif and AME approaches are exponential in the number $k$ \pjm{Can we use a different symbol?} of opinion states, rendering both methods infeasible. 
	In contrast, it is possible that an extension of our moment-closure methods could scale as $\Theta(k^2)$, which may well be computationally tractable. 
	%Further generalizations may also be possible. 
	While we developed our approximations for the specific case of the binary-state AVM, that development relies only on three base ingredients: symmetry-breaking, timescale separation, and mean-field majorities. 
	We conjecture that these ingredients should be present in any adaptive model with homophilic dynamics in which rewiring steps involve uniform selection from an extensive subset of the graph, such as a subset sharing a given node state. 
	An example of a more complex system in which these ingredients are present is the networked evolutionary prisoner's dilemma game of \cite{Lee2017a}, in which nodes display richer strategic behavior in their opinion update and rewiring behavior. 
	Despite this behavior, the existence of a phase transition driven by homophily may allow for the deployment of the Markovian assumption in this case as well. 
	% An example coevolutionary model to which our methods may not be applicable is the transitivity-reinforced dynamics of \cite{Malik2016}. 
	% Because nodes tend to rewire within their neighborhoods, timescale separation may not be a practical assumption.
